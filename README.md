# Tanzania-Price-Data

A methodology is presented for predicting local market prices across time and space, leveraging sparse pooled observations of market prices from various locations and times. This work primarily targets wholesale prices for grains (six cereals and beans) and potatoes in Tanzania. 
The whole workflow is compiled in this R markdown file - Tanzania_price_predictions-notebook.Rmd in the codes folder.
